Accessible websites allow everyone to use the web, regardless of physical differences or limited computer hardware. Accessible sites are generally faster to access and easier for searching engines to index. In other words, accessibility can make your site works better and makes easier for others to find it. For this project, I have made a website for the fictional rock band â€œAccessible Frog" easier for users to access.
