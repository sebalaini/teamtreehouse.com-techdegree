# First_Project_Treehouse.com

For my first project, I practiced web design skills by customizing a web page to create a personal profile page. I modified the code for a basic web page by adding graphics, custom text and a stylish design. This was a great way for me to practice HTML and CSS skills. I also added a page that calling card to show my experience, skills and goals, and to provide links to my social media accounts. I put this project up on GitHub, an important tool used by millions of developers.
