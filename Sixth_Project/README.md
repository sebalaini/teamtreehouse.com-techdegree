Graphics are an important part of any website. They add visual appeal and help translating complex ideas into easer ones to understand imagery. One type of image, SVG (scalable vector graphics) is becoming a widely used graphics format, replacing other types of images on many websites, because of SVGs better performance. This project challenged me to optimize a web page by using common techniques for adding this streamlined image format to web pages.

# Know issue:
