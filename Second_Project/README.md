In this project, I received a design mockup for a complete web page. Turning a visual design into a functional web page is a common task for a web developer. This project also required the application of industry best practices for creating sites that work well on different devices. Using what's called a responsive layout, and a mobile-first design I have built a page that literally transforms its presentation to fit on the screen where you see it.
