# Twelfth_Project_Treehouse.com

In this project I build an online portfolio to showcase the work I’ve created as part of this program, and any projects I’ve built on my own. This is my chance to show the world the work I’ve done. In fact, the portfolio site itself is a great way to show what I can do. Bring all of my talents with HTML, CSS Jquery and JavaScript together to create a fun and interactive online portfolio. I hosted the portfolio site on the web using free GitHub Pages.
