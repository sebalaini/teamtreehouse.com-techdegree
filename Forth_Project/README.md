From blogs to eCommerce, interactive image galleries are everywhere. In this project, I have created an interactive photo gallery using JavaScript. Users will see a page of small, thumbnail images. Using JavaScript, you'll add interactivity so that when an image is clicked, a large version pops-up on the screen. I added the functionality to let users search for specific images, and navigate through a slideshow using a keyboard.
