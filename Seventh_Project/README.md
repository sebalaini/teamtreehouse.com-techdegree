Rich media experiences provide an increasingly important way make a website stand out from the crowd. You'll find videos used in blogs, marketing material and the home pages of many web sites. In this project, I have built an HTML5 video player using JavaScript and the HTML5 Video API. Using supplied designs, video files, and a transcript, I have built an interactive video player that lets viewers start and stop the video, and even jump to specific spots in the video simply by clicking the text transcript.
